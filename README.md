   ```json
   "homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>",
   "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

3. Deploy the app by running:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. Go to your repository on GitHub:
   - Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Pages**.
   - Under "Source," select the `gh-pages` branch and click **Save**.

The app will be live at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`.
